Situated in the Dutch coastline city The Hague I've been developing my photography skills over the past 20 years, always directed by my passion for the art of photography and the need to document life as I experience it.

A large part of the images you will find here can be categorized as [street photography](/tags/street-photography), capturing everyday life in [contrast](/tags/life-in-contrast) and- less frequent -[tone](/tags/life-in-tone). My only goal is to present my perspective on the world. To quote Garry Winogrand, *“I photograph to see what the world looks like in photographs.”*

When I'm not roaming the streets I occasionally do [portrait assignments](/tags/portrait) or do more [conceptual work](/tags/phart) which you can find under [Phart](/tags/phart) (Photo Art). There's also a category [Women](/tags/women) where I share my enthusiasm when it comes to the female form; some might consider this content inappropriate to be viewed in an office environment.

**I invite you to take a look at my portfolio and hope my work is able to moves you in some way.**
