Situated in the Dutch coastline city The Hague I've been developing my photography skills over the past 20 years, always directed by my passion for the art of photography and the need to document life as I experience it.

A large part of the images you will find here can be categorized as [street photography](/tags/street-photography), capturing everyday life in [contrast](/tags/life-in-contrast) and- less frequent -[tone](/tags/life-in-tone). My only goal is to present my perspective on the world. To quote Garry Winogrand, *“I photograph to see what the world looks like in photographs.”*. Most of these photographs are private work, but I also do street documenting work on assignment. A neighbourhood, a street or maybe a shopping mall? I will walk around and find the special moment and turn it into a candid and natural photo raportage.

When I'm not roaming the streets I occasionally do [portrait assignments](/tags/portrait) or do more [conceptual work](/tags/phart) which you can find under [Phart](/tags/phart) (Photo Art). The post processing and compositing of images are all done by myself in Adobe Photoshop with which I have extensive experience and expertise. If you're stuck on an image and you need some help or do you have an old photo you would like to have restort? I can help out.

I like to work with people who value quality over quantity. My aim for a photoshoot or a portrait, candid or otherwise is to have a couple of images that are authentic and can stand the test of time. I'm not the type of photographer that keeps on shooting and delivers 300 images. I want to make sure we're the right fit for each other, so you will get the experience you're hoping for.

**I invite you to take a look at my portfolio and hope my work is able to move you in some way.**
